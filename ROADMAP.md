Goal: Quantify Command

Process:
Take biomechanics data from Driveline internal databases
Filter all motion capture biomechanics to just use pitchers who were throwing a command bullpen trying to throw fastballs down the middle at 90% intensity or higher
Find the matching intended zones data for each pitch
Combine command and time sequenced biomechanics data to analyze factors influencing command
Looking to analyze mechanics through the lens of dynamical systems theory and chaos theory
Planning to analyze a Lyapunov's exponent for mechanics at each segment for every time in every throw
Look to quantify repeatability vs adaptability
This will ideally show how much repeatability or adaptability a pitcher needs, quantifying command will ideally outline where exactly command is being negatively impacted to make improvements, or what a pitcher does well.
